### The What and Why of Notion Template Shops

Notion template shops are online stores—typically on platforms like Gumroad, Sellfy, or Shopify—where you can sell productivity-boosting templates crafted within the Notion app. These templates can be anything from project management systems, habit trackers, or content planning templates. Why are they so popular? Because people pay for pretty productivity—they're more likely to use a well-designed, easy-to-navigate template that saves them time and energy.

So, why should you consider setting up a Notion template shop? Here are a few reasons:

1. Monetize your productivity: If you're already a Notion power user, why not capitalize on your skills and share your expertise with others who want to reap the benefits of this incredible app?
2. Empower others: By selling your templates, you're not only making money but also helping others become better organized, focused, and productive.
3. Flexibility: With a Notion template shop, you're your own boss. You choose what to create, how much to charge, and when to work.
