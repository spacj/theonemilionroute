## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 14 project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

This command sets up a new project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint configured out of the box.

## App Router Fundamentals

The App Router introduces a new paradigm for routing in Next.js applications. Unlike the traditional Pages Router, the App Router uses a file-system based routing built on React Server Components.

### Key Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
2. **Better SEO**: Enhanced server-side rendering capabilities
3. **Streamlined Development**: More intuitive file structure

## Building Your First Route

Creating routes in the App Router is straightforward. Simply create a folder structure under the `app` directory:

```
app/
├── page.tsx          # Home page (/)
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx      # About page (/about)
└── blog/
    ├── page.tsx      # Blog list (/blog)
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx  # Blog post (/blog/[slug])
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 with the App Router represents a significant leap forward in React application development. The combination of Server Components, improved routing, and enhanced performance makes it an excellent choice for modern web applications.

Start experimenting with these new features today and experience the future of React development!
